Removes the Wordpress credit on the default Wordpress theme and replaces with a widget sidebar for those wanting to customise the theme.

== Description ==
= Remove "Proudly powered by WordPress" =

This plugin removes the "Proudly powered by WordPress" for those who want to use the default theme for their website but don't want everyone to know what they've used to build it. Content can then be added in its place with a new "Site Info" widget area.

This plugin works on all default Wordpress themes including ...

- Twenty Nineteen (widget area not implemented as it's not suitable)
- Twenty Seventeen
- Twenty Sixteen
- Twenty Fifteen
- Twenty Fourteen
- Twenty Thirteen
- Twenty Twelve
- Twenty Eleven
- Twenty Ten

This was probably the smallest and simplest plugin ever written ;-)

== Installation ==

Easily remove the Wordpress credit on the default Wordpress theme ...

1) Install Remove "Powered by Wordpress" automatically or by uploading the ZIP file.
2) Activate the plugin through the “Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
3) Turn off the plugin by deactivating it or through "Theme Options" menu in the Theme Customizer.
4) Optionally add content by dragging a widget (eg Text widget) into the new "Site Info" widget area.
